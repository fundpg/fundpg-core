                We won ETH Denver 2023 by building a product that allows you to allocate a percentage of your yield to funding public goods via the <Link href="https://bounties.gitcoin.co/grants/12/gitcoin-grants-official-matching-pool-fund"><span className="font-bold">Gitcoin Matching Pool.</span></Link>
                <br/><br/>
                We also made a merch collaboration between <Link href="/merch"><span className="font-bold">Gitcoin and Creatures World</span></Link> for ETH Denver 2023, where 100% of the proceeds went to funding public goods.</p>

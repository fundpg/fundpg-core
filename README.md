# Goal
Our goal is to create a platform where users can stake into DeFi protocols and direct a portion of their yield towards funding public goods, without risking their initial investment. We believe that this innovative approach can help increase public good funding and support important causes.

# How It Works
We are currently working on a proof-of-concept for the ETHDenver Buildathon, where we are building upon the Aave protocol. Our aim is to leverage the benefits of Aave's lending and borrowing features, while also integrating a mechanism for users to donate a portion of their yield to public goods.

# Who We Are
Our team consists of experienced developers and experts in the DeFi space who are passionate about using technology for social good. We believe that FundPG has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about donations and make a positive impact on society.
